Observe that only the input files are present:

$ ls
A  example_01.mf  README  sim.exe


Run as...
$ makeflow example_01.mf

...and now observe the output files generated according to the rules
in example_01.mf:

$ ls
A  B  C  example_01.mf  README  sim.exe


To re-run, first clean previously generated outputs:

$ makeflow example_01.mf -c
