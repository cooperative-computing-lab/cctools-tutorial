The only rule in the makeflow file is designed to failed. Here we retry each
rule 2 times:

$ makeflow -r 2 example_03.mf
...
2019/02/19 11:11:48.32 makeflow[20112] notice: job ./broken_sim.exe A B > log-of-A-to-B failed too many times.
nothing left to do.

The partial results of failed rules will be in directories makeflow.failed.N,
where N is the number of the rule that failed (starting at 0):

$ cat makeflow.failed.0/log-of-A-to-B 
trying step 1 of ./broken_sim.exe A B
trying step 2 of ./broken_sim.exe A B
trying step 3 of ./broken_sim.exe A B
an error! oh no!
