Run the workflow in work queue:

$ makeflow -Twq -M ${USER}-my-makeflow example_04.mf

We use -M to name the master, thus it can be any string you want. Here we
${USER}-my-makeflow to ensure that all the participants in the tutorial choose
a different name.

In another terminal, check the status of your master with:

$ work_queue_status

(or work_queue_status | grep ${USER}-my-makeflow)

Feed a worker to your master:

$ work_queue_worker --single-shot -M ${USER}-my-makeflow

Here we use --single-shot to quit after disconnecting from the master. (By
default workers are long-lived and can work for many masters.)

Alternatively, here we launch 1 worker using condor (that last 1 is the number
of workers requested):

$ condor_submit_workers --cores 1 --memory 2048 --disk 4096 -timeout 60 -M ${USER}-my-makeflow 1
